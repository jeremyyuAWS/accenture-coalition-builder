It was clear that you and Michael have a deep understanding of the enterprise analytics space, and your questions helped us articulate our differentiation even more clearly.\n\nAs requested, I've attached our detailed financial model including unit economics, customer cohort analysis, and growth projections. A few key highlights:\n\n• Current LTV/CAC ratio of 4.2x with payback period of 14 months\n• 95% gross revenue retention expanding to 115% net retention\n• Clear path to $10M ARR by end of 2024 based on current pipeline\n\nI'd love to schedule that technical deep dive with Dr. Chen within the next week. Jane is excited to walk through our ML architecture and scalability plans in detail.\n\nThanks again for your time and interest!\n\nBest,\nJohn"
